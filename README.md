## Problem Statement

**FreshCart's Advertising Challenges:**

1. **Inefficient Ad Spend:**
   - FreshCart suspects that not all their digital advertising dollars are generating the desired return on investment (ROI).
   - Some campaigns may be costing more than they contribute in revenue.

2. **Identifying Effective Channels:**
   - FreshCart faces difficulty in determining which advertising platforms (search engines, social media, etc.) yield the best ROI.
   - Choosing the right channels is crucial in a competitive online grocery market.

As FreshCart aims to optimize its digital ad spend, addressing these challenges becomes essential. üöÄ

## Project Objective: Optimizing FreshCart's Digital Ad Spending

**Specific Objectives:**

1. **Evaluate Campaign Effectiveness:**

   - Segment the audience based on demographics (age, gender, location).
   - Evaluate engagement levels (likes, shares, comments) for each demographic group.

4. **Recommend Budget Allocation Strategies:**
   - Based on insights, propose adjustments to the ad budget allocation:
     - Allocate resources to high-performing channels.
     - Optimize spending for maximum impact.

## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated

- filters

## Modelling
![Alt text](assets/images/freshcartdash.jpg)
Certainly! The data model displayed in the screenshot combines two tables: "ad_campaign_data" and "DateTable." A relationship links these tables. The model helps analyze advertising metrics, track performance over time, and optimize ad spending for FreshCart. 

The ‚Äúad_campaign_data‚Äù table is the fact table and The ‚ÄúDateTable‚Äù is the dimension table.

## Dax Measures

### 1. Conversion Rate
- **Purpose:** Calculate the percentage of conversions relative to total clicks.
- **DAX Expression:**
  ```DAX
  Conversion Rate = DIVIDE(SUM(ad_campaign_data[Conversions]), SUM(ad_campaign_data[Clicks]), 0)
  ```
- **Explanation:** This measure divides the total conversions by total clicks, handling cases where there are no clicks (denominator is zero).

### 2. Cost Per Conversion
- **Purpose:** Determine the cost associated with each conversion.
- **DAX Expression:**
  ```DAX
  Cost Per Conversion = DIVIDE(SUM(ad_campaign_data[Cost]), SUM(ad_campaign_data[Conversions]), 0)
  ```
- **Explanation:** This measure calculates the average cost per conversion.

### 3. CTR (Click-Through Rate)
- **Purpose:** Measure the effectiveness of ads.
- **DAX Expression:**
  ```DAX
  CTR = DIVIDE(SUM(ad_campaign_data[Clicks]), SUM(ad_campaign_data[Impressions]), 0)
  ```
- **Explanation:** CTR calculates the ratio of clicks to impressions.

### 4. ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
- **Purpose:** Evaluate revenue generated relative to advertising costs.
- **DAX Expression:**
  ```DAX
  ROAS = DIVIDE(SUM(ad_campaign_data[ConversionValue]), SUM(ad_campaign_data[Cost]), 0)
  ```
- **Explanation:** ROAS quantifies how efficiently ad spending translates into revenue.
