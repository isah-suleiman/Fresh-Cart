## Problem Statement

**FreshCart's Advertising Challenges:**

   - FreshCart suspects that not all their digital advertising dollars are generating the desired return on investment (ROI).
   - Some campaigns may be costing more than they contribute in revenue.

2. **Identifying Effective Channels:**
   - FreshCart faces difficulty in determining which advertising platforms (search engines, social media, etc.) yield the best ROI.
   - Choosing the right channels is crucial in a competitive online grocery market.

As FreshCart aims to optimize its digital ad spend, addressing these challenges becomes essential. üöÄ
